                                “He who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress”
                                <p><i>– Anwar Sadar</i></p>
                            </div>
                            <p>For most of my life, I’ve been an expert at playing it safe. The limited rigor of high school coursework gave me a sense of achievement without needing to stray far from my comfort zone. Academically, I’ve always been a highly decorated student. Entering college, my plan was to continue this pattern – follow the rubrics, check the boxes, and get the 4.0. I thought I’d be perfectly happy coasting through undergrad, having a good time and studying hard, until my first appointment with my Honors advisor. As I quickly found out, the South Carolina Honors program is the top in the country for good reason. Every student is required to complete a meaningful Beyond the Classroom experience and propose, create, and defend a thesis representing the culmination of my undergraduate career. I’d been so confined to rubrics and standardized testing that I couldn’t fathom the thought of stepping off the beaten path of the Computer Science major map and defining my own journey to graduating with Honors. A small, shameful, and very familiar part of me even contemplated dropping Honors just to shed the heightened expectations that came with it, but I buried this feeling to embrace my first semester.</p>
                            <p>During our initial meeting, my advisor registered me for a random Honors elective to ease me into fulfilling the program requirements. I anticipated this course to resemble a high school Honors class, perhaps paced a little faster or presenting some additional material. However, from the first day of class, I quickly realized it resembled nothing I’d ever taken before. SCHC 274, Fundamentals of Business Inquiry, was an intensive, seminar-style exploration across different disciplines of business, in which our class of 30 bright-eyed freshmen heard firsthand from experts across Darla Moore and read stimulating books by thought leaders Adam Grant and Malcolm Gladwell. The first few chapters of Adam Grant’s “Originals” created a paradigm-shifting awareness of the scary, uncertain, and tantalizingly fruitful world of opportunities that lay outside of my comfort zone. <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#kiModal1">This essay</a>, which I wrote in response to our first reading assignment, marks the beginnings of a powerful shift in which I began to recognize the strengths in the ability to think outside of the box.</p>
                            <p>These thoughts stirred an interest inside me, but it wasn’t until sophomore year when I next experienced a change in perspective by participating in recruitment for the Gamecock Consulting Club. Initially, I was excited for the challenge this new experience would bring, squeezing through recruitment and receiving an invitation to join the Spring 2022 onboarding class. I entered the six-week process with gleeful excitement – and then I emerged not only more knowledgeable about the competitive consulting industry, but also with the most dreadful case of imposter syndrome I’d ever felt. I was certain that I had absolutely nothing worthy to contribute to a club full of wildly intelligent people with stacked resumes and job offers at Fortune 500 companies. My sole consolation was the fact that I’d always have my major, computer science, as a safety net to fall back on.</p>
                            <p>Soon after becoming a fully integrated member of the club were leadership elections for the upcoming semester. I had no plans to run for any position – I knew nothing about handling finances, wasn’t qualified to communicate with alumni, and had no experience with which to educate other members. However, when nobody stepped in to run for Director of Events, the friend who’d convinced me to join the club nominated me off the floor. I hated her for putting me on the spot, but the part of me that woke from reading Adam Grant stirred and I felt a surge of nervous excitement. I prayed that nobody else would run against me – I couldn’t bear the thought of losing in front of the entire club – and before I knew it, I’d become the GCC Director of Events for Fall 2023.</p>
                            <p>Immersing myself in a leadership position opened many avenues for creativity, innovation, and learning that both scared and excited me. The most trailblazing skill I gained was the ability to create deeper relationships with people around me. One of my primary responsibilities was creating a <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#newsletterModal">weekly newsletter</a> that summarized key updates from the different leadership teams and dispensing it to the club. This required constant communication with the very people on exec that I’d felt inferior to, and I came to love every intimate opportunity to learn from an individual’s diverse experiences and subsequently share my own. Through these valuable interactions, my feelings of inadequacy dissipated. I was right in the mix of things, seeing the inner workings of the club and watching and helping as small ideas metamorphosized into real events. I’d believed that my lack of relevant experience marked me with as a sign of weakness and the difference of my major would make me stand out. Instead, I learned to leverage these disparities to develop my individual leadership style, define my position my own, and eventually make significant contributions as I went on to become elected as Vice President of Internal Operations.</p>
                            <p>Reflecting on this experience, I realize how much easier it was to overcome my imposter syndrome by leveraging the momentum of initial discomfort to dive in and fully abandon my comfort zone. I learned that the best way to overcome my beliefs was to put myself in situations that forced me to overcome them. By doing so, I literally <i>proved</i> that I was capable of defying self-doubt. From this, I experienced a radical shift in perspective in which I stopped putting opportunities and dreams below my fear of failure. These newfound insights are further supported by the work of Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes, the women who first coined the term “imposter phenomenon”. In <i>The Imposter Phenomenon: Overcoming the Fear That Haunts Your Success</i>, a seminal piece of literature on the topic, they affirm the importance of defining your true abilities through one’s actions rather than emotions. As I discovered for myself, one can break free from the “Imposter Cycle” – a repeating loop of worry, immobility, frenzied work, success, and temporary relief – by leveraging the reality of our accomplishments to dispel the negative emotions and disrupt the patterns. </p>
                            <p>The most defining testament of my progress came the summer before junior year. Casually checking my email, my heart skipped a beat when I noticed a message with “Congratulations” in the subject line. After a semester of immersing myself in GCC, my efforts had culminated into acceptance into Ernst & Young’s Empower Consulting Program, an exclusive opportunity to network and learn from some of the brightest women in consulting at their Charlotte office. This opportunity was the highest form of validation, proving that I <i>did</i> have what it takes to be a consultant. However, the acceptance wasn’t the most defining moment of this experience. That moment came with the familiar sense of doubt that immediately flooded in, much like the one that had me previously questioning my ability to remain in the Honors College. It evoked a range of embarrassing scenarios – what if I couldn’t find parking or the office? What if I didn’t know the answer to a question? It encouraged me to decline, craving the familiarity of sorority recruitment that I’d otherwise be attending in Columbia. This conference would be my first real foray into the corporate world, the ultimate testament to my ability to hang with the big dogs, and I had every right to feel scared. However, I pushed away the thoughts of discomfort and RSVP’d before I could change my mind. That moment of defiance, at the intersection of the known and unknown, was what ultimately kickstarted my career in technology consulting at EY.</p>
                            <p>From that summer on, I felt a renewed sense of empowerment in my place in the world as more than a student. No longer was I confined by the belief that I could only excel in the classroom. By constantly pushing back on creeping thoughts of imposter syndrome, I proved them wrong time and time again. Of course, I still face self-doubt nearly every day, but now I know how to deal with it by reminding myself of how much I’ve gained from taking risks and how much of my own untapped potential is still out there, waiting for me to discover it.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>From an early age, I’ve always believed that a secure, prosperous career lay within technology. I never struggled with the decision of choosing a major; as the daughter of a software developer whose college tuition was heavily funded by a portfolio of Microsoft, Adobe, and other tech monoliths, following the promising path of computer science was a no-brainer.</p>
                            <p>My ability to solve problems, learn syntax, identify errors, and produce the correct output went hand-in-hand with the structured field of computer science. Logic, data structures, and algorithms are completely objective, and I excelled at following these rules. As I wrote in <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ki2-artifact1">one of my first college assignments,</a> the field offers “an enticing challenge with no gray area when it comes to failure or success”. However, my early-founded determination to excel on this path of critical thinking and logic resulted in a trade-off of softer skills like creativity. The biggest loss I suffered was my ability to write.</p>
                            <p>As a young child, I once dreamed of becoming a best-selling author. However, my hobbies and career aspirations evolved as I grew older. As I became more interested in computers, writing became more of a chore than a passion. My skills, which had already been atrophying throughout high school, took a major hit when I arrived at South Carolina with enough credits to bypass any Carolina Core classes outside of my chosen field. I was thrilled with this opportunity to fully immerse myself in my studies, paving my way through the computer science curriculum and enrolling in class after class full of logic and algorithms. I excelled in my studies while suppressing growing feelings of burnout and exhaustion until I hit a wall that brought me face-to-face in confrontation with the part of myself that I’d left behind.</p>
                            <p>During the fall of my junior year, I enrolled in SCHC 350, “From Gutenberg to Google”, an exploration of the birth and death of the book. Our first readings covered Walter J. Ong’s “Orality and Literacy”, a work that paints a remarkably detailed picture of how the written word completely restructured the human consciousness forever. He describes writing’s legacy as the most revolutionary technology in human history through granting us the abilities to record thoughts, share stories, and communicate abstract ideas. Reading Ong’s work sparked an initial shift in my perspective that was soon put to the test. The module’s accompanying assignment was to write a paragraph on any subject we wanted, with a catch: the focus of the piece was to capture the sound and feel of spoken words through a medium that was quickly becoming obsolete – writing by hand. </p>
                            <p>Initially, I disliked this task because of how broad the prompt was. My computer-science brain, so conditioned to syntactic restrictions and programmatic constraints, could see nothing but gaping room for errors. There was no foundational idea to latch on to, so I had no idea where to start. However, after twenty minutes of brainstorming and dismissing topics, I forced myself to stop overthinking and just write. After finding an initial foothold, the words began to flow and I felt a thick cloud in my brain slowly start to dissipate. This was the first time in two years that I’d held a pencil for a purpose beyond taking notes or an exam, and I began to feel a deep release. Thirty minutes later, I’d produced a <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ki2-schc350">simple passage about finding beauty in small moments,</a> a topic that I was particularly passionate about, and I’d felt the gentle stirring of a long-lost ability to bring shape to my emotions. This was a sensation I hadn’t encountered in years, partly because I could never justify carving time out of my demanding schedule and partly because I associated creative writing with a barrage of mental barriers. For me, stringing effective sentences together was mentally taxing in a way that lines of code were not. However, this assignment shifted the beliefs that’d cemented into my head and gave me a taste of the joy that I’d once derived from shaping my own ideas and creating my own stories. After overcoming that initial hurdle, I found each subsequent assignment of the semester equally enjoyable, bursting with insightful experiences and reflective opportunities. However, these fleeting memories were quickly forgotten over winter break as I transitioned into one of the most demanding semesters of my life.</p>
                            <p>The following summer, I was introduced to the brain dominance theory when I first picked up Stephen Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People”. He describes how research has identified two very different roles for each of our brains’ hemispheres. The left is the logical one, granting analytical abilities to break down complex problems and approach them in a process-oriented, sequential manner, while the right is more intuitive, allowing us to think artistically and harness our holistic, unbound creativity. You could probably guess which side my computer-science brain was most conditioned to. The majority of individuals would likely agree – our society praises individuals in analytical, information-dominant sectors like tech and finance, and my generation grew up watching companies like Apple and Amazon dominate entire industries. However, I only have myself to blame for choosing to pigeonhole my entire identity into this competitive environment. On the path I laid out for myself, I believed that recognition and rewards were reserved for those who could produce solutions and strategic value, not those who could write passionate declamations about creating happiness. Unfortunately, that summer of 2023 ended too quickly for me to finish the book and I was soon plunged back into a 17-credit-hour schedule and multiple extracurriculars. However, I faced these challenges with a heightened awareness of my right brain’s abilities, although I still had no idea how to fully harness them.</p>
                            <p>During that fall semester, I was recruited to assist a local entrepreneur orchestrate a conference for Columbia business owners on potential applications of artificial intelligence in their businesses. I had been staffed with the belief that I’d work on web development, but my role had unknowingly switched to creating marketing content for the conference. Instead of building out a full-stack webpage, I was to write a weekly blog post to be posted on LinkedIn as an educational “sneak peek” of what would be covered at the event. Although this was far from what I’d expected, I tried my best to embrace the challenge. What better opportunity to immerse myself in the fastest-growing technology trend of 2023 than to read and write about it, especially with the potential of reaching a large audience? I reasoned with myself that this experience could ignite personal growth by bridging a gap between my computer-science background and my communication skills. Eventually, this assignment did indeed act as a catalyst, but not in the way that I’d anticipated.</p>
                            <p>Very quickly, my task became a hindrance. I was given a list of weekly topics, such as “Demystifying AI Jargon” and “How Microsoft Bing Can Supercharge Your Marketing Strategy”, interesting ideas that held promise but had <i>all</i> been written about already. As my competing priorities grew and communication from my supervisor dissipated, writing the articles became more and more exhausting. I was essentially regurgitating facts and ideas from dozens of existing articles on the Internet that already covered the exact topics I was given. I wondered more than once why my supervisor didn’t just curate a collection of existing articles written by the conference’s experts and speakers instead of having an inexperienced college student struggle to replicate them at poorer quality and with less credibility. Luckily, a reinvigorating opportunity came at just the right time when I’d covered all my given topics, leaving me free to choose my own. Now, I could <i>finally</i> write about something that was both interesting to me and hadn’t been done before. Despite spending a disproportionate amount of time and energy perfecting this <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ki2-article">one article,</a> the process flew by. The difference that <i>choosing</i> the topic made had helped me step into a flow state at the intersection of interest, passion, and focus. It reframed a tedious task into an opportunity to build my knowledge, articulate my learnings, and express potential impacts. <Artifact – blog post> The contrast between my approach to this task and the SCHC 350 assignment is fascinating – one year prior, I had hesitated at the open-endedness of the prompt, but now I was practically begging to be allowed some room for creativity.</p>
                            <p>The bridge between these two experiences came in the form of the freedom I’d experienced through translating my interests and passions into my own words. Throughout middle and high school, I’d been conditioned into believing that the writing process should mirror programming: given a prompt, construct a document that will deliver the correct output. After years of writing essays to strict rubrics and research papers on assigned topics, I’d lost touch with the enjoyment of the process, forgetting how to express myself from the heart instead of the brain. Then, I rediscovered that feeling through the handwritten assignment, and learned exactly how to tap into it through the AI engagement. These experiences allowed me to reconnect with the joy that had founded my childhood dreams of becoming an author and reminded me why writing was once something I held so important.</p>
                            <p>In contrast to the intense focus and concentration that I’d been honing throughout three years of computer science and math classes, writing allows me to intentionally enter a lighter state of flow and clarity. In this flow-state, I feel more connected than ever to my consciousness, my inner voice, and the parts of me that dream big, crave knowledge, and chase personal growth. It gives me the creative energy to express myself, share my passions, and grow through reflection. Stephen Covey would be proud – I’d finally discovered the pathway to my brain’s right hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>Through these experiences, I now appreciate the synergistic potential of my entire brain and how it can help me find my purpose and stay aligned with my values. I learned how tapping into the mental clarity and artistic vision of my right brain allows me to paint a complete picture of the person I want to be and the future that I want to create. I discovered writing as the medium for constructing my dreams and defining my aspirations by harnessing them into words infused with power, purpose, meaning, and hope. Then, by tapping into my logical, process-oriented left brain, I can create and fine-tune smaller, incremental goals that allow me to level up every day and progress towards my personal vision. I never would have imagined how rekindling a childhood passion would help me find such clarity, and I hope that this journey will inspire others currently searching for their full potential to begin by looking in the unlikeliest places.</p>

You may be as creative and as colorful as you like in exploring the affordances of the written word, but remember: the focus of this task is as much on the medium of handwriting as it is on the message handwritten. (2) Type up a brief (one page) explanation of how the handwritten techniques in your declamation work. What challenges did you encounter? How effectively do you think you addressed them?</strong></p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The college experience is a quintessentially unique chapter of our lives. This period is marked by the transition from teenager to adult and characterized by social networks just as much as academics. Arguably, college is the only time of our lives where it is acceptable and even normalized to go out every night of the week without the burden of responsibilities to others, like family members or employers. While academics play the most significant role on paper, a large part of the college experience is defined by the people that we choose to surround ourselves with.</p>
                            <p>Coming to a huge SEC school as an out-of-state student, I knew that participating in Panhellenic sorority recruitment wasn’t a question. I was ecstatic at the notion of finding a sisterhood of like-minded women who could help me create a home away from home. However, the relationships that Kappa Kappa Gamma gave me extended far beyond the social friendships I’d expected to find. Immediately after the recruitment process ended, I was welcomed into the chapter with open arms. I felt a deep bond with the girls in my pledge class, especially knowing that we were the only ones on campus to share the experience of virtual recruitment after the pandemic. My sorority did an amazing job of integrating us into the chapter, making us feel right at home despite lingering capacity restrictions. Within the Honors dorm, I found a mini network of Kappas who would go on to become my very best friends. Being able to share not only a Greek affiliation but also a deeper passion for higher achievement with these girls was incredibly special, reaffirming my decision to join a sorority. Even more important, in the post-pandemic era, we shared an invisible bond through the experiences we lost, a bond that only strengthened our shared desires to embrace new opportunities. The friendships that I developed during freshman year laid the foundation for my future experiences.</p>
                            <p>	It’s no secret that the people you surround yourself with dictate the kind of person that you become. During the spring of my sophomore year, I discovered how I could leverage this compounding effect by <i>becoming</i> the friend who uplifts others. SCHC 326, an Honors service-learning course, provided the perfect avenue to experiment with bridging this gap. This brand-new course was like no other, taught by Dr. Doyle Stevick at the UofSC Anne Frank Center, which is the official U.S. partner of the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. The curriculum not only covered the Holocaust and its impact through the legacy of Anne Frank, but it also provided us with the opportunity to share our learnings by leading the public in guided tours through the Center. We were completely immersed in our learnings; this was not just a class, but an opportunity to reflect on human nature and to develop our abilities to speak up and advocate for what’s right. Taking this course with my best friend and roommate made the experience exponentially more impactful, as it allowed us to continue these important conversations outside of class. We led multiple tours together, but the one that remains in both our hearts was one that included several of our roommates and closest friends in our sorority house. The ability to share something for which we’d grown such an intense passion with some of my closest friends who’d never seen this side of ourselves was a defining moment. By leveraging the foundation of our friendships, we were able to communicate our message at a deeper, more vulnerable level. <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ki3-afc">This article</a> does a beautiful job expressing the impact of the work we did throughout the course and the importance for young adults to leverage their positions to inspire activism and make a difference in our peers. From this experience, I discovered a calling to share more powerful messages to uplift the people around me and create a positive ripple effect.</p>
                            <p>The UofSC Student Success Center’s core mission revolves around the importance of peer-to-peer experiences in helping students achieve their academic and personal goals. I joined as a Peer Consultant in the spring of my sophomore year to meet with students struggling with time management and study skills, but it wasn’t until a year later that I took a step up to leave a greater impact on the program itself. <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ki3-cohort">New Peer Leader Cohort</a> is a mandatory weekly programming for all peer leaders working in their first semester at the SSC, designed to help them develop their individual leadership styles and accumulate the skills necessary to work with students of all backgrounds, identities, ages, and abilities. I enjoyed Cohort when I was a new peer leader, so in the spring of 2023, I was ecstatic to be given the opportunity to teach a weekly cohort alongside a full-time SSC staff member. Facilitating Cohort embodied the purpose and mission of the SSC itself; by using my position as a peer, I was able to distill my experiences down and share my knowledge in a way that was relatable so that these budding peer leaders would soon be able to do the same. Although we only met once a week, I was able to develop deeper relationships with the members of my cohort through vulnerable conversations and appreciating different perspectives. This experience allowed me to expand my desire to uplift others beyond my immediate friend group and into the workplace itself.</p>
                            <p>Serving as the Vice President of Academic Excellence of Kappa Kappa Gamma allowed me to bridge my passion for my sisters with my passion for academic success. Again, by leveraging the diversity of my experiences, I was able to create unique opportunities that engaged chapter members while promoting positivity. My greatest legacy in this position was a week-long competition called <a href="#" class="pdf-link" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ki3-exambreakers">Exam Breakers</a> that spanned the week before finals. I organized daily events at the sorority house designed to promote de-stressing techniques, such as morning yoga and cookie decorating. Members in each pledge class competed to accumulate the most study hours, attend the most events, and practice self-care in the hopes of winning a Chick-fil-a breakfast during finals week. Implementing incentives and increasing the number of opportunities to stay engaged during the most stressful time of the semester allowed me to uplift members and give them reasons to stay motivated, study hard, and continue taking care of themselves. Since I stepped down from this position in the fall of 2022, the Exam Breakers legacy has persisted every semester since. Knowing that I was able to create such a positive impact in the organization that gave me my best friends and the best memories truly felt like a full-circle moment.</p>
                            <p>These experiences showcased the importance of leadership and initiative within student-led organizations on campus, which our university is fortunate to have hundreds of. The “Three Degrees of Influence” theory coined by James Fowler and Nicholas Christakis in their book <i>Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks</i> underscores the boundless potential that one individual’s actions can have on those around them. This theory states that one’s social influence can “ripple through our networks [to have] an impact on our friends (one degree), our friends’ friends (two degrees), and even our friends’ friends’ friends (three degrees).” As students at a huge university, we are each in unique positions of power to synthesize our diverse backgrounds and experiences to share and learn from others and to create positivity in those around us. By creating a more positive environment for those around me, I also created a rebounding effect upon myself that further inspired me to continue leaving impacts among my various social circles. As my time in college draws to a close, I’m thankful to have been able to experience this phenomenon for myself by leveraging my peer-to-peer networks to create change for the better.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Throughout human history, we’ve seen the emergence of dozens of revolutionary technologies that fundamentally changed the way society functioned. From the advent of the written word to the introduction of computers, the human race has rapidly advanced, allowing us to explore and harness more and more of the world. Along the way, there have always been skeptics – for example, Plato presented a similar argument to those used today by skeptics of computers against the written language, citing its innate “unnaturalness” and the increased likeliness of weakening the mind and memory<sup>1</sup>. On the other hand, there have always been technophiles, who argue in favor of rapid technology adoption with little consideration of potential risks. In SCHC 350, I engaged in thoughtful discussion about the pros and cons of different philosophies on technology usage. However, the introduction of generative AI (artificial intelligence) has created an unprecedented technological disruption that requires an entirely new way of thinking.</p>
                            <p>What separates generative AI from other technologies is its ability to produce creative human-like output in the form of text, images, code, and other types of media. Formerly, traditional software and machine learning models were limited to a finite amount of training data with the capacity to automate very specific tasks. On the other hand, generative AI can produce unlimited novel outputs based on given prompts and its ability to constantly learn from new data, user sentiment, and given feedback. What distinctly separates this technology from others is its human-like ability to understand complex contexts and adapt to different tasks, then generate quality, highly-tailored responses. While it’s still not perfect, the potential use cases for generative AI are virtually boundless, extending far beyond what we can predict and into nearly every sector of the economy.</p>
                            <p>As more and more businesses integrate this technology into their ways of working, the role of employees is shifting. Companies cannot ignore potential cost reductions and increased productivity from outsourcing repetitive tasks such as data entry and creating content to a cheaper, faster, and (often) more reliable alternative to human labor: generative AI. A <a href=" https://www.key4biz.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Global-Economics-Analyst_-The-Potentially-Large-Effects-of-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Economic-Growth-Briggs_Kodnani.pdf" target="_blank">report by Goldman Sachs<sup>2</sup></a> describes the impact of this disruption as having the potential to affect 300 million full-time jobs. However, we need not worry about jobs being completely eradicated – like other revolutionary technologies, AI has the potential to create entirely new industries and, naturally, many jobs along with them. However, as we still remain in the very early stages of an AI-embracing society, we are faced with a daunting question – what kinds of skills are needed to stay successful and resilient when so much of the future is unknown?</p>
                            <p>This question is exceedingly important in the context of higher education institutes, which not only work to prepare students for specialized careers but also help them develop broader “life skills” that will enable them to navigate the broader world on their own. In a <a href=" https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/universities-must-transform-ensure-no-one-left-behind-era-ai" target="_blank">December 2023 AI symposium in New York<sup>3</sup></a>, presidents Teruo Fujii of the University of Tokyo and Joseph Aoun of Northwestern University came together to emphasize the need for universities to shift from long-standing traditional paradigms on education and begin instilling students with the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to remain relevant in a constantly evolving economy. What makes this problem difficult is the uncertain landscape of the future that AI will create – as the technology continues to evolve, grow, and disrupt traditional ways of thinking, there’s no way to predict what the workplace will look like in one year from now. However, although we may not know the exact circumstances that students will face in the real world, this does not provide universities with an excuse to delay the first step towards change. In order to continue preparing students for success in a constantly changing world, higher education needs to adopt a new approach towards educating students.</p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-4" style="color: #ACCFAC">
                                <p>SCOPE OF ISSUE</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>I’ve identified three core traits that both educators and employers deem essential for “future-proofing” students to succeed in a world of AI. They are <b>autonomy</b> (the ability to function independently and make critical, informed decisions), <b>cross-disciplinary thinking</b> (the ability to learn and synthesize information across different disciplines), and <b>creativity</b> (being able to generate novel ideas to solve problems). These critical-thinking skills are broadly defined and much more subjective than current metrics for academic success, such as grade-point average. This inherent subjectiveness is likely the reason why the majority of higher education institutes haven’t yet responded to the disruptive effects of AI – traditional education has been rooted in numbers and grading scales for so long that change may seem extremely hard to reach. However, the Darla Moore School of Business (DMSB) serves as a great example for cultivating these 3 essential traits in students.</p>
                            <p>The DMSB is a globally-renowned institute, known for top-ranked academics and immersive student experiences. It’s also the commonality that ties each of my most impactful college experiences together. From my connections with peers in the Business School, I’ve participated in case competitions, joined organizations, expanded my networks, and left my comfort zone while continuously building a cross-disciplinary skillset, iteratively refining my personal vision of success and charting a course towards reaching it. Something about the abundance of opportunities and experiences that Darla Moore provides to its students feels incredibly empowering, and the taste that I got while completing my Business Administration minor left me wanting more. In contrast, I felt like an outsider in my own school, the Swearingen College of Engineering and Computing (CEC). While it offers a variety of student-tailored resources and opportunities, such as a Career Center and student organizations, they each feel siloed and compartmentalized. For example, the CEC often brings potential employers to table in Swearingen, but I’d never learned how to build my resume or network with a professional employer, so I never had the courage to utilize these opportunities.</p>
                            <p>Several other key differences between the DMSB and CEC highlight a critical opportunity for the University to improve the experience for undergraduate engineering students. For one, it is highly unlikely to find an engineering student pursuing a dual degree, (with the exception of Computer Science & Mathematics). In contrast, DMSB supports and sometimes requires students to pursue multiple pathways – for example, business students in Management are required to enroll in a second business major to ensure that they are adequately prepared in a variety of functional areas. Additionally, the DMSB undergraduate curriculum ensures that students are equipped with a solid foundation for success in the business world, supplementing a good mixture of business basics with hands-on experience and real-world skills, such as BADM 301, a course dedicated to networking, interviewing, and career planning. On the other hand, the CEC curriculums are centered around building technical knowledge and hard skills, but severely lack any support for professional development or building autonomy for a post-graduation life. Finally, it’s critical to mention the Faber Center for Entrepreneurship, a pivotal program that allows students to leverage their knowledge through in-depth consulting projects as part of their coursework, therefore gaining skills through experiential learning to foster an entrepreneurial mindset. These hands-on experiences provide value as “collaborations between academia and industry”, supplementing students with wide-ranging knowledge and real-world applications needed to “tackle today’s complex challenges”, which are essential components of the recommendations made at the <a href="https://baiforum.jp/en/report/re090/" target="_blank">New York AI symposium.<sup>4</sup></a> However, the Faber Center is a complete subset of Darla Moore, and the College of Engineering and Computing has no counterpart, therefore lacking a critical opportunity to connect engineering students with the broader community.</p>
                            <p>In highlighting these differences, I think it’s important to acknowledge my understanding that engineering and business are very different disciplines, so of course I do not expect that the programs should be completely identical. As a Computer Science major, I understand the importance of having a strong technical foundation so that I can easily pick up new programming languages and synthesize my knowledge of structures and algorithms to solve problems. However, we must remember that generative AI also has the ability to write and debug code, and it becomes more accurate by the day. Therefore, to prepare students to succeed in an uncertain future, the CEC has plenty of opportunities to future-proof students with the three skills mentioned earlier (autonomy, cross-disciplinary thinking, and creativity), and it can begin by addressing the shortcomings I’ve identified above.</p>

                                <p>Implementation Plan</p>

                            <h5 style="font-weight:500">— Purpose + Objectives:</h5>
                            <p>As millions of jobs are at the risk of being displaced by generative AI, employers are seeking candidates with qualities that exhibit resilience and adaptability, which are by products of skills discussed above: autonomy, cross-disciplinary thinking, and creativity. The purpose of this project is to equip undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina College of Engineering and Computing with these skills. In order to monitor progress towards achieving this goal, we can set and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on relevant metrics in each area. Examples of effective KPIs include:</p>
                            <p style="color: #ACCFAC; padding-left:1rem; font-weight:600">Autonomy:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Percentage of CEC graduates employed in roles where these skills are valued, based on USC graduation surveys or employment data</li>
                                <li>Retention rates of CEC students, compared with historical data on retention rates</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>In CSCE 594 (Strategic Management of Information Systems), we covered the importance of defining and monitoring Key Performance Indicators in order to proactively monitor the status of important projects, which could easily be displayed on an interactive dashboard to quickly communicate key information with project management executives. As I learned in this class, strategic organizational change cannot be implemented without choosing the right information systems. It’s worth noting the abundance of ways that AI is actively transforming the capabilities of these systems, from accelerating key processes to increasing accessibility of data to help inform strategic decision-making for executives. Generative AI can play a key role as an informed partner in brainstorming and structuring relevant data – I even utilized it above to help generate some potential KPIs. This is just one example at hand of its many use cases in today’s knowledge-based economy.</p>


                            <h5 style="font-weight:500">— Proposed Solution:</h5>
                            <p>There are 2 phases in my proposed solution, the first of which focuses on injecting more autonomy and cross-disciplinary thinking into the current CEC degree structures and curriculums. The second then dives into strategies for fostering relationships between the CEC, the Faber Center for Entrepreneurship, and other organizations in order to create more opportunities for fostering entrepreneurial spirit in students through collaboration and creativity.</p>

                            <h5 style="font-weight:500">— Evaluation:</h5>
                            <p>The intended outcomes of this project will affect a significant number of key stakeholders at the University of South Carolina, including CEC students, alumni, faculty, and employers. Some form of an evaluation phase played a key role in every significant project that I’ve completed during undergrad. In CSCE 572 (Principles of Human-Computer Interaction), I learned several different evaluation methods for assessing a solution’s functionality, understanding its effects on users, and identifying specific problems. There are 2 key forms for evaluation: <span style="color:#ACCFAC">formative</span>, which continuously occurs throughout the entire project life cycle, and <span style="color:#ACCFAC">summative</span>, which takes place after the project has been completed. Both types of evaluation play a critical role in ensuring that implementation remains aligned with solving the core issues at hand.</p>
                            <p>The Key Performance Indicators identified under <b>Goals + Objectives</b> will serve as critical tools for summative evaluation. They will be measured before the project begins, then continuously monitored after implementation is complete. These metrics will allow the CEC to gauge the effectiveness and impact of the project.</p>
                            <p>In order to monitor progress throughout the implementation process, it is necessary to create multiple avenues for feedback and input from key stakeholders. These formative methods of evaluation should begin with regular progress meetings with the CEC project management team. During these meetings, management should discuss and assess the completion status of the tasks outlined above, while also addressing any issues that may arise in a timely manner. Additionally, feedback from students, faculty, and staff throughout the transition process is essential to ensure that the CEC remains aligned with their best interests. Phase 2 of this proposed solution (expanding the Faber Center) has a significant increase of moving parts due to the emphasis on community involvement, which will require lots of touchpoints and check-ins with local employers, start-up founders, alumni, potential speakers, and more. In order to optimize the evaluation process, it’s important to create a detailed, structured evaluation plan that will ensure success and mitigate risks along the way.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, the strategic utilization of generative AI will further strengthen the implementation process. It can be leveraged in a variety of ways, such as breaking down problems into key tasks, performing quality control and data analysis, serving as an informed advisor, extracting insights, and much more. Again, I fortified this proposed implementation with generative AI to help me structure my ideas into concise bullet points. This is another testament to the potential synergy of human creativity and AI. My background knowledge and real-life experiences of the DMSB and CEC can never be displaced by this technology, and I was able to strengthen the quality of this plan by utilizing it in the correct way. </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-4" style="color: #ACCFAC">
                                <p>Conclusion</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Throughout the past four years, I’ve seen the world change radically. From my very first semester at South Carolina, which was defined by the pandemic, I learned to embrace the unknown. As time went on, covid dissipated, and society let its guards down, generative AI took its opportunity to create disruption, and the definition of “normal” remained unwritten. Between covid restrictions and ChatGPT, I may have never had a ‘traditional’ semester of college. I embraced this challenge to learn, adapt, and push myself out of my comfort zone, leading to new insights about my personal and professional growth, some of which you’ve read about in this portfolio. However, I was fortunate to have built a strong support network and a large number of connections. Many students, especially those in the Engineering school, don’t have these networks, and consequently, they may miss out on valuable experiences that they don’t even know exist. This lack of accessibility to resources combined with the sheer unknown of the future highlight a clear area of opportunity for the University of South Carolina College of Engineering and Computing.</p>
                            <p>While concluding this proposal, it’s essential to acknowledge the diverse viewpoints of stakeholders, which extend beyond students and potential employers to include faculty, alumni, industry leaders, and more. The University of South Carolina is the state’s flagship institution for good reason, and there are many existing structures, traditions, and perspectives outside the scope of my knowledge from the past four years that must be considered. The diverse challenges posed by artificial intelligence are unpredictable and complex, requiring a delicate balance of collaboration and prior knowledge with innovation and forward-focused thinking by University leaders. To successfully undergo such large-scale institutional change, faculty must be willing to part with old ways and explore different teaching methods. Change may be hard and scary, but with the rise of artificial intelligence, it’s also inevitable.</p>
                            <p>By considering the solutions outlined above, the CEC can better serve its students by making them more resilient, helping them build autonomy, providing them real-world knowledge and opportunities to develop interdisciplinary skillsets, and fostering more creative mindsets. In doing so, the University will not only become more aligned with its mission to become one of the best institutions in the world, but it will also give its students the blueprints and toolkits necessary to confidently chart their own paths to success in a new world where, despite the uncertainty, anything can happen. </p>
